## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


This exercise I was able to learn to use display flex for the order of the page an example:

```html
  <section>
        <div >
            <h>I have bad news <br> for you</h>
        </div>

        <div clase=" texto2">
            <p>The page you are looking <br> for might be removed or is <br> Temporarily Unavailable</p>
        </div>
       
        <a target="_blank" class ="btn" href="">BACK TO HOMEPAGE</a>
        </section>
```
```css
section{
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
    }
```
### Continued development
- I will continue practicing to have a better handling of DOM, studying and consulting my mentors so that every day I improve my knowledge.

 ### Useful resources
